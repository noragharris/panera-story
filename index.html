            It was a dark and stormy night...
            <br>
            in a shadowy wood.
            <br>
            And there was NO scary clown because it is not that kind of a story.
            <br>
            But there totally was an axe murderer running around, so, oops.
            <br>
            But Allie and Nora were total badasses and got the axe murderer first. BOOM. MIC DROP.
